<p style="background-color: color: SlateBlue ;">Hello! My name is Majida Hatamleh, and many know me as Fajer. I am from Jordan and live in Irbid. 
    I finished my Bachelor's degree in Management Information systems from Al Balqa Applied University in 2014 
    and my master's degree in Electronic Business Administration from Jadara University in 2017.
    In the same year, I’ve had the opportunity to work as a digital marketing and branding officer in a pioneer company in Technology Consulting and Cyber Security fields for a year.
    Recently, I participate in a Software Development camp with Abdul Aziz Al Ghurair School of Advanced Computing (ASAC), I'm very happy to learn with wonderful people.</p>
